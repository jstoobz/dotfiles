description: Capture the session's initial user prompt, analyze its effectiveness, and generate an optimized version. Use when the user says "/prompt-lab", "capture my prompt", "optimize my prompt", "prompt lab", or wants to save and improve the prompt that kicked off the session. Produces PROMPT_LAB.md with the original prompt, analysis, and a refined version for reuse and learning.

# Prompt Lab

Capture the original session prompt, analyze it, and generate an optimized version. Builds prompt engineering intuition over time.

## Process

1. **Check for existing file** — Read `./PROMPT_LAB.md` if it exists. If found:
   - Preserve previous entries under a `## Previous Prompts` heading
   - Add new entry as the primary (top) section with updated timestamp

2. **Identify the initial prompt** — Find the user's first substantive message that defined the session's work. This is the raw prompt exactly as written.

3. **Analyze the prompt** against these dimensions:
   - **Clarity** — Was the goal unambiguous?
   - **Scope** — Was the scope well-defined or open-ended?
   - **Context provided** — Did it give enough background?
   - **Constraints** — Were boundaries/requirements stated?
   - **Actionability** — Could Claude act immediately or needed clarification?

4. **Generate the optimized prompt** — Rewrite incorporating:
   - Everything learned during the session
   - Context that had to be discovered/clarified mid-session
   - Specific file paths, module names, or technical details that emerged
   - Explicit scope boundaries
   - Skills to load
   - Clear success criteria

5. **Add coaching notes** — Brief, specific tips about what made the difference between the original and optimized versions.

6. Write `PROMPT_LAB.md` in the current working directory.

## Output Format

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Session:** {branch or topic}

## Original Prompt

> {Exact verbatim copy of the user's initial prompt, in a blockquote}

## Analysis

| Dimension     | Rating                                     | Notes                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Clarity       | {good/fair/vague}                          | {specific observation}          |
| Scope         | {focused/broad/undefined}                  | {specific observation}          |
| Context       | {sufficient/partial/missing}               | {what was missing}              |
| Constraints   | {explicit/implicit/none}                   | {what should have been stated}  |
| Actionability | {immediate/needed-clarification/ambiguous} | {what blocked immediate action} |

**What worked well:** {1-2 things the prompt did right}

**What cost time:** {things that required clarification or discovery mid-session}

## Optimized Prompt

> {The rewritten prompt — ready to copy-paste into a new session}
>
> {This should be self-contained: include context, constraints, relevant paths,
> skills to load, and clear success criteria. A new Claude session reading only
> this prompt should be able to start working immediately.}

## Prompt Tips

{2-4 bullet points — specific, actionable lessons from this prompt. Not generic advice.}

- {Tip grounded in what actually happened this session}
- {Tip about what context/constraint would have saved time}

## Rules

- **Verbatim original** — Copy the exact original prompt, warts and all. No editing.
- **Honest analysis** — If the prompt was great, say so. If it was vague, say that too. No flattery.
- **Optimized != longer** — The best prompts are concise. Add specificity, not word count.
- **Session-specific tips** — Generic prompt advice ("be specific") is useless. Ground every tip in what actually happened.
- **The optimized prompt must be self-contained** — Someone should be able to paste it cold into a new session and get productive immediately.
- Write to `./PROMPT_LAB.md` unless the user specifies a different path
