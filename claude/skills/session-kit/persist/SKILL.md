name: persist
description: Save a specific artifact from the current conversation to ~/.stoobz/ for future discovery via /index. Use when the user says "/persist", "save this", "keep this", "persist this", "stash this for later", or wants to capture a reference artifact (table, runbook, research doc, architecture notes, comparison, plan) without ending the session. The in-flight companion to /park.

# Persist

Save a reference artifact from the current conversation to `~/.stoobz/` with manifest indexing. The in-flight companion to `/park`.

```
/park     → "save everything, I'm leaving"
/persist  → "save THIS thing, I'm still here"
/index    → finds both
```

## Process

1. **Identify the artifact** — Look at recent conversation context. What did the user just produce or want to keep? Could be:
   - A table, comparison matrix, findings summary
   - A research doc or brain dump distillation
   - A runbook, playbook, or how-to
   - Architecture notes or decision records
   - A plan, checklist, or investigation notes
   - Raw output from a tool or analysis

   If ambiguous, ask: "What should I persist?" with the most likely candidates.

2. **Determine naming:**
   - `/persist` → auto-name from content (slugified heading or topic, max 50 chars)
   - `/persist <name>` → use the provided name as-is
   - `/persist <name> <tag1> <tag2>` → name + explicit tags
   - Filename: `<name>.md` (always markdown, always kebab-case)

3. **Determine project:**
   - If in a git repo: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
   - Otherwise: `basename $(pwd)`

4. **Determine tags:**
   - Explicit tags from the command take priority
   - Otherwise auto-detect 2-5 tags from the artifact content
   - Languages: elixir, python, javascript, typescript, ruby, go, rust, sql, powershell, bash
   - Frameworks: phoenix, ecto, oban, react, next, absinthe, liveview
   - Topics: debugging, performance, migration, refactor, investigation, auth, deployment, testing, infrastructure, playbook, runbook, architecture, comparison

5. **Write the artifact:**
   - Path: `~/.stoobz/<project>/<name>.md`
   - If file already exists, ask: "Overwrite `<name>.md` or save as `<name>-2.md`?"
   - `mkdir -p` the project directory if needed
   - Extract/format the content as clean markdown
   - Add a small footer: `_Persisted from <project> session — <date>_`

6. **Update manifest** — Read-modify-write `~/.stoobz/manifest.json`:
   - If file doesn't exist, create with `{"sessions": []}`
   - If corrupted, backup as `.bak` and create fresh
   - Check if entry with same `archive_path` exists → update in place
   - Otherwise append new entry

   **Manifest entry:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "<name>",
     "project": "<project>",
     "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
     "label": "<name>",
     "summary": "<first heading or first line of content>",
     "source_dir": "<absolute path to cwd>",
     "archive_path": "<project>/<name>.md",
     "branch": "<git branch or null>",
     "artifacts": ["<name>.md"],
     "tags": ["playbook", "tailscale"],
     "type": "reference"
   }
   ```

7. **Confirm:**

```
Persisted to ~/.stoobz/<project>/<name>.md
  Tags:  playbook, tailscale, powershell
  Find:  /index <name>  or  /index --deep <any-term-in-content>
```

## Examples

```
User: [produces a deployment methods comparison table]
User: /persist

→ Persisted to ~/.stoobz/utm/deployment-methods.md
  Tags:  windows, deployment, comparison
  Find:  /index deployment
```

```
User: /persist auth-flow-notes auth architecture

→ Persisted to ~/.stoobz/insurance/auth-flow-notes.md
  Tags:  auth, architecture
  Find:  /index auth-flow-notes
```

```
User: /persist quick-assist-runbook playbook tailscale

→ Persisted to ~/.stoobz/utm/quick-assist-runbook.md
  Tags:  playbook, tailscale
  Find:  /index playbook
```

## Rules

- **One artifact per call** — To persist multiple things, call `/persist` multiple times.
- **Always markdown** — Output is always a `.md` file. Format content cleanly.
- **Don't over-format** — Preserve the artifact's natural structure. Don't wrap a table in unnecessary headings.
- **Infer from context** — When called without a name, look at what was just discussed/produced and pick the right content and name.
- **Tags are cheap** — 2-5 tags. Better to over-tag than under-tag. These power `/index` search.
- **Flat in project dir** — Files go directly in `~/.stoobz/<project>/`, not in subdirectories. The manifest `type: "reference"` distinguishes them from session archives.
- **Don't duplicate** — If the content already exists in the archive (same project, same name), update in place.
- **No session ceremony** — This isn't `/park`. No TLDR, no relay doc, no prompt lab. Just save the thing.
