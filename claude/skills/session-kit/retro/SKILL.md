# Retro

Session retrospective — honest reflection on process, not just outcomes.

## Process

1. **Check for existing file** — Read `./RETRO.md` if it exists. If found:
   - Preserve previous entries under a `## Previous Retros` heading
   - Add new entry as the primary (top) section with updated timestamp

2. **Analyze the session** across these dimensions:
   - **Time well spent** — What activities moved the needle?
   - **Time wasted** — What rabbit holes, false starts, or unnecessary detours happened?
   - **Approach effectiveness** — Was the strategy right? Would a different order have been better?
   - **Tool/skill usage** — Which skills helped? Which were missing?
   - **Communication** — Were instructions clear? Did misunderstandings cause rework?

3. **Identify patterns** — If previous retros exist, look for recurring themes.

4. Write `RETRO.md` in the current working directory.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Retro

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Session:** {branch or topic}
**Duration:** {approximate — short/medium/long}

---

## What Went Well

- {Specific thing that was effective — with why}
- {Approach or decision that saved time}

## What Took Longer Than Expected

- {Activity}: {why it took longer} — {how to avoid next time}

## What I'd Do Differently

- {Concrete change for next time — not vague aspirations}

## Tool & Skill Notes

- {Skill that was useful}: {what it helped with}
- {Skill that was missing}: {what it would have helped with}
- {Process improvement}: {workflow change to try}

## Recurring Patterns

{Only if previous retros exist — themes that keep showing up}

## Rules

- **Honest over polite** — If the session was unproductive, say so. If the user's prompt was vague, note it.
- **Specific over generic** — "Spent 20 minutes on X before realizing Y" beats "could have been more efficient"
- **Actionable items only** — Every "do differently" must be something concrete you can actually do
- **Credit the wins** — Don't just focus on problems. Note what worked so it can be repeated.
- **Pattern recognition** — When previous retros exist, flag recurring issues. That's where real improvement lives.
- Write to `./RETRO.md` unless the user specifies a different path
